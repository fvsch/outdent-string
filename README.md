# outdent.js

An experiment to detect and remove extraneous leading whitespace from multiline strings, especially for HTML code.

Only tested in latest Firefox, Safari and Chrome (in 2014).
Fair warning: this was a personal experiment, might be unstable and have subpar performance.

## Documentation

There isn’t much. See [this article](https://fvsch.com/outdent-js) for an introduction, and look at the [outdent.js file](outdent.js) directly.

## Running the demo page

The demo can be run using PHP’s built-in development server:

```sh
php --server localhost:8000
```

Then open http://localhost:8000/demo.php in your browser of choice.
